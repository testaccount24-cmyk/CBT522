No, but I have a stand-alone utility that can take an external
record and put an SMF header on it and issues the call to write
it to SMF.

Interested?

I've offered it to our applications folks to be able to write
applications level and business statistics for incorporation
into a PDB of application data statistics.

 Anyone have an assembler subroutine, callable by COBOL which
 can write user SMF record.  It could save me some time.
